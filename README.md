# A study on Homomorphic encryption approach to Federated learning
This repository contains codes for a proof-of-concept implementation of a biometric authentication system using privacy-preseving federated learning system.
The architecture of the federated learning model itself is mainly from the original MaskCrypt, however it is modified to train on locally downloaded SOCOFing dataset (preprocessed and set up into ImageFolder format), with a customized local CNN model.
